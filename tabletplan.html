                                    <p class="mbr-fonts-style panel-text display-4">&gt; This plan is one of the most popular plans for cellular internet due to it being unlimited AT&amp;T high speed data, relatively easier to use than other carriers' "<a href="options.html#features1-t" class="text-secondary">Untraditional</a>" plans, and for only $20/month. So, if you <a href="index.html#features24-k" class="text-secondary">started here</a> with <a href="index.html#features24-k" class="text-secondary">Step 1</a> and discovered that AT&amp;T is a good carrier in your area, this is a good option for a cellular internet plan.<br><br>&gt; This $20/month AT&amp;T Postpaid Unlimited Tablet/iPad Plan we are referring to is specifically the unadvertised&nbsp;<em>standalone</em> tablet plan, not the advertised normal add-on tablet plan (<a href="page2.html#gallery1-35" class="text-secondary">view differences in chart below</a>). The name “standalone” is not an AT&amp;T official name of the plan - it is just the unofficial name the community uses to distinguish the plans.<br><br>&gt; The current name of this plan is "<em>AT&amp;T Unlimited Tablet</em>" - it has gone by different names in the past and sometimes the name itself refers to both the standalone and the add-on tablet plans, so that sometimes adds to the confusion. <a href="page2.html#timeline2-3c" class="text-secondary">View the recent history of this plan below</a>.<br><br>&gt; The plan is completely unlimited &amp; <a href="settings.html#content14-27" class="text-secondary text-primary">unthrottled</a> data.<br><br>&gt; The only thing is that there may be possible <a href="settings.html#content14-27" class="text-secondary text-primary">deprioritization</a>. Which just means that your speeds may slow down some depending on the cell tower traffic (not due to throttling, but due to being lower on the tower's priority list for available bandwidth). However, on AT&amp;T, most people don't even notice the depri, either because it rarely happens or, even when it does, it is still usable speeds. Of course, this all depends on your specific location and specific currently connected cell tower traffic. (You may get a text from AT&amp;T after using 16.5 GB of data <a href="assets/files/16GB-Text.pdf" class="text-secondary text-primary" target="_blank">like this</a>, but this is an ignorable standard text that usually doesn’t mean anything when it comes to depri, since AT&amp;T depri usually isn’t noticeable or impactful for most users.)<br><br>&gt; The plan also includes 10 GB of high speed hotspot data, then it is throttled to 128 Kbps afterwards. It does not mention this info anywhere in the plan descriptions. Also, the hotspot data usage will not show up on the myAT&amp;T online account until hotspot data is actually used (then it will <a href="assets/files/Compare-Hotspot.pdf" class="text-secondary" target="_blank">look something like this</a>). However, this only affects people using the SIM in a tablet. If they use the SIM in a device that can change the <a href="settings.html#tabs1-1t" class="text-secondary text-primary">APN</a>&nbsp;(ie. cellular router), then they can avoid using hotspot data to remain unthrottled.<br><br>&gt; It is a completely standalone plan, and you do not need a phone plan to get it at the $20/month price (unlike the other carriers). Although, you can also get it if you do have a phone plan with AT&amp;T. So, this plan is available to new and current AT&amp;T customers both with phone plans or without.<br><br>&gt; This plan includes the Stream Saver (SS) feature that “lets” you <a href="settings.html#tabs1-1t" class="text-secondary text-primary">throttle video streaming</a> or not. If you don’t want the video throttle, you can turn off SS. (The <a href="assets/files/ATT-UnlimitedTablet.pdf" class="text-secondary" target="_blank">plan description</a> on the myAT&amp;T account actually says that the plan only has SD video streaming, but the description is wrong and the plan actually does include the SS feature to turn off and get HD+ video.)&nbsp;<br><br>&gt; The plan is $20/month plus taxes &amp; fees. These vary by location, but most people report that the taxes &amp; fees are less than $5. The average we have found is around $3.50 (<a href="assets/files/Bill-Example.pdf" class="text-secondary" target="_blank">here's an example</a>). When you first get the plan, AT&amp;T will send something to you called the "Customer Service Summary" (CSS). More than likely it will have a bunch of charges on it that make this $20 plan look closer to $30-40/month. But the CSS is absolutely inaccurate and a waste of time - so completely ignore it and wait for your actual first bill. Be aware that the first bill usually has a prorated charge for the first few days of using the plan + the first full billing cycle month + a possible activation fee.<br><br>&gt; Why does this standalone plan exist? <a href="page2.html#content17-38" class="text-secondary">View Note #1</a>&nbsp;(below).</p>

The add-on tablet plan is listed on the website and advertised, but not the standalone plan (<a href="page2.html#gallery1-35" class="text-secondary">view differences in chart below</a>).<br><br>&gt; The main thing that you need to get this plan is a LTE/5G tablet/iPad <a href="settings.html#tabs1-1t" class="text-secondary text-primary">IMEI</a>. How you get that IMEI is up to you. So some people buy a new tablet. Some buy an old/used/broken tablet. Some find an IMEI on eBay. Some use an IMEI generator. However, even if you are going to put the SIM in a cellular router, we do recommend getting a LTE tablet (if you don't already have one) - mainly so you can own the IMEI and avoid the potential issues with other methods. Where can I get a cheap tablet?&nbsp;<a href="page2.html#content17-38" class="text-secondary">View Note #2</a>.<br><br>&gt; The only way to get this plan is directly from an AT&amp;T representative - in store (preferably an AT&amp;T corporate store), over the phone, or via online chat. And you have to get a SIM from AT&amp;T for this plan during sign up, you cannot bring your own SIM.<br><br>&gt;&nbsp;The main issue with getting the plan is that not all the reps know about this plan or will give out this plan. So wherever you go to get the plan, it just depends on which rep you get, if they know about the plan, &amp; will give it out. Just keep trying until you find a rep that will help.&nbsp;<br><br>&gt; If you want to try over the phone, you should just be able to call them up and ask them for the standalone tablet plan (<em>NOT</em> the add-on plan, and don't mention hotspot, as that seems to cause the reps confusion sometimes). They will ask for the IMEI of your tablet and then your personal info (SSN, DL, etc - Why do they ask for this? <a href="page2.html#content17-38" class="text-secondary">View Note #3</a>). The number to call is <a href="tel:1-855-593-1430" class="text-secondary">1-855-593-1430</a> (or <a href="tel:1-800-288-2020" class="text-secondary">1-800-288-2020</a> has been reported to work too) and most people suggest calling during normal business hours (Eastern time). If you get a rep that doesn't know about the standalone plan, then just call back until you find one. However, most people that call that number are able to sign up relatively easy because the reps at the 855 number usually know about the standalone plan. Also, they may offer to waive the $30 activation fee. If they don't offer to waive the fee, then you can ask them before you sign up. If they won't waive the fee, some people have been able to waive the fee via their online account after getting the plan (How do I do this?<strong>&nbsp;</strong><a href="page2.html#content17-38" class="text-secondary">View Note #4</a>). They usually ship the SIM overnight via FedEx. Some have even gotten theirs in about 18 hours after they called. (By the way, since the 855 number is the sales department, they might offer you other services &amp; products, but just say no if you aren’t interested. Also, we have received community reports that an in-store rep confirmed that the 855 number is a real AT&amp;T sales department direct number - even though sometimes the number redirects to AT&amp;T's international call centers with sometimes less trained reps.)<br><br>&gt; If you decide to get the plan at a corporate store, we recommend calling the store before wasting your time going to one - call to confirm that they know about the $20 standalone tablet plan and that they can sign you up for it. Also, some reps don't care if you bring just the IMEI number, but other reps do want you to have the tablet in hand to get the plan.<br><br>&gt; If you decide to get the plan via online chat, just be aware that this is the least successful option. There are reports that some people have been able to get it via chat, but there are also a lot of reports of unsuccessful attempts.&nbsp;<br><br>&gt; Sometimes when people sign up for this plan, there is a requirement about accepting the Terms &amp; Conditions (T&amp;C) for the plan. This sometimes causes glitches in their system. What glitches can happen with the T&amp;C? <a href="page2.html#content17-38" class="text-secondary">View Note #5</a>.&nbsp;<br><br>&gt; Sometimes people get a rep who claims to know this plan and will claim to sign them up for this standalone tablet plan, but end up signing them up for the add-on tablet plan instead of the standalone tablet plan. On the rare occasion that this happens to you, you have two options: 1. Call AT&amp;T and see if you can get a rep to switch the plan to the standalone tablet plan (some people have reported success with this). 2. Call AT&amp;T to cancel the add-on tablet plan, then try again to get the standalone tablet plan.</p>

However, if it does not, you should be able to activate the SIM on AT&amp;T's website&nbsp;<a href="https://www.att.com/checkmyorder/activations/activateDevice.rt" class="text-secondary" target="_blank">here</a>&nbsp;or by calling in.&nbsp;<br><br>&gt; There are 3 common SIM sizes (<a href="https://www.whistleout.com/CellPhones/Faqs/218195558-What-are-the-different-SIM-sizes-and-which-phones-use-which-SIM-size-" class="text-secondary" target="_blank">Standard/Mini, Micro, Nano</a>), and the SIM size they send you is based on the size of the SIM of the device IMEI given to the AT&amp;T to sign up for the plan. This may be relevant to the size of the SIM slot of the device that you want to put the SIM in. What if you have the wrong size SIM? <a href="page2.html#content17-38" class="text-secondary">View Note #6</a><br><br>&gt; If you purchase a tablet from AT&amp;T when you sign up for the plan and depending on the specific tablet, it may come with the plan on an eSIM. What if you have the plan on an eSIM? <a href="page2.html#content17-39" class="text-secondary">View Note #7</a><br><br>&gt; Once you get the plan/SIM:<br> <br>1. Make sure to register for and/or login to <a href="https://www.att.com/myatt/lgn/resources/auth/login/haloc/goto-login" class="text-secondary" target="_blank">myAT&amp;T</a> to get familiar with the online account management. Unfortunately, sometimes there are issues with this. What if I have issues logging into my account?&nbsp;<a href="page2.html#content17-39" class="text-secondary">View Note #8</a><br><br>2. Turn off Stream Saver on your myAT&amp;T account (to avoid <a href="settings.html#tabs1-1t" class="text-secondary text-primary">video throttle</a>). <a href="https://www.att.com/support/article/wireless/KM1169198/" class="text-secondary" target="_blank">Instructions here</a>. Unfortunately, some people have reported still getting video throttled after turning off Stream Saver - <a href="page2.html#content17-39" class="text-secondary">View Note #9</a><br><br>3. Use cases:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;A. If you want to use the SIM inside of your tablet as a normal tablet, go ahead and use away like normal. You could also connect your tablet to a TV or monitor with specific adapters or wirelessly ("casting", "Airplay", etc) - this allows some people to stream video onto their TV from their tablet without using hotspot data.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;B. If you want to use the SIM inside of your tablet, but use the hotspot/tethering feature (<a href="assets/files/USB-TetherTabletSetup.pdf" class="text-secondary" target="_blank">maybe even USB tether to a WiFi router</a>), it is possible, but the plan only includes 10 GB of high speed hotspot data, then throttled to nearly unusable speeds. So, you will have to mask hotspot data, which is against the TOS (Terms of Service). <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;In order to do this on an iPad, you will need to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jailbreaking_(iOS)" class="text-secondary" target="_blank">Jailbreak</a> and then install a Jailbreak Tweak called <a href="http://cydia.saurik.com/package/net.tetherme.tetherme8/" class="text-secondary" target="_blank">TetherMe</a>&nbsp;- which will let you use WiFi hotspot and USB tethering while masking hotspot data usage. Unfortunately, not all iPads are able to be Jailbroken on all iOS versions - here's a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/11DABHIIqwYQKj1L83AK9ywk_hYMjEkcaxpIg6phbTf0/htmlview" class="text-secondary" target="_blank">chart</a> to help figure that out. Jailbreaking is not usually that difficult, but it is all dependent on what specific model and iOS version you have. Each one is different and there are multiple different Jailbreaking tools out there. Additionally, sometimes it is easier to Jailbreak when you have a Mac. Therefore, we recommend using the chart linked above to help point you in the right direction.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;In order to mask hotspot data on an Android tablet, there are a few options. First, you can use an app that will mask hotspot data, like <a href="http://pdanet.co" class="text-secondary" target="_blank">PDANet</a> or <a href="http://www.mobile-stream.com/easytether/android.html" class="text-secondary" target="_blank">EasyTether</a>. Unfortunately, these only work with a companion app that has to be installed on a computer/router/device that supports the companion app. Second, you might be able to try messing with some APN settings in the Settings app - something having to do with DUN values or adding ",dun" to the APN. This may only work on unlocked devices and some people report that this method is no longer working. Third, you can look into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooting_(Android)" class="text-secondary" target="_blank">Rooting</a> your Android, which is like iOS Jailbreaking. This should unlock access to certain parts of the tablet's settings in order to mask hotspot data, or at least allow you to install an app to do this.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;C. If you want to use the SIM inside of&nbsp;a cellular router/hotspot device there are a few settings that need to be changed.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="settings.html#tabs1-1t" class="text-secondary text-primary">APN</a> = broadband (this will avoid using hotspot data) <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="settings.html#tabs1-1t" class="text-secondary text-primary">IMEI modification</a> (this will protect from shutdown, but it is a little tricky)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;IMEI modification is important because if you want to use this plan in in an unapproved device for the plan (a non-tablet/iPad), that is against the TOS. Therefore, AT&amp;T will detect this in an unmodified cellular router and eventually shut down the line. In order to avoid getting shut down, IMEI modification is necessary.<br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="settings.html#tabs1-1t" class="text-secondary text-primary"><strong>Learn more details about IMEI modification and resources on how to do it</strong></a>.<br></p>

The purpose of the standalone vs the add-on tablet plan is to allow a customer that has the max 10 lines to get another tablet plan. If a customer has 10 lines, but they want a tablet plan, the system will not allow a rep to add the add-on tablet plan. However, the rep is then supposed to use the system to add the standalone tablet plan so the customer can have another tablet line, even though they have the max 10 lines. There is nothing in the system to prevent a rep to sell this standalone tablet plan to someone who doesn’t have a phone plan. But some reps are not trained properly or they don’t care and want to make the sale.</p>

The tablet doesn’t need to function. However, keep in mind that with some tablets, the only way to get the IMEI is to turn it on. Some do have it on the box or on the back of the device. <br><br>So, we usually recommend these places. <br><br>3rd Party <br>• Amazon (refurb or cheap new) <br>• Walmart (refurb or cheap new) <br>• BestBuy (open box) <br>• Decluttr (cheap refurb) <br><br>Private Market <br>• Swappa <br>• OfferUp <br>• Facebook Marketplace <br>• Craigslist<br><br>Be careful on the private market, though. Lots of scammers. But if you are wise, you can get a great deal.

In order to do a credit check, they will need to ask you for your SSN (Social Security Number), possibly your DL (Driver's License number), address, etc. The good news is that, as of the end of July 2020, carriers have been required to no longer do hard credit checks and only do soft credit checks. If you are worried about your credit check, there are reports of people with bad credit still able to sign up for this plan, as long as they don't try to finance a device and only get the plan by itself.</p>

This is a known issue for some, who have no other lines, to log into their myAT&amp;T account. The reason for this is because of the Two Factor Authentication (2FA) security on the account. It’s not usually a problem because people will either have phone lines on the account that will receive the 2FA texts or they have the SIM in a tablet/device that receives texts. <br><br>However, if you are unable to get 2FA texts, what you need to do is call customer service and request that they disable 2FA on the account. Now, not many reps know how to do this, so it may take a few tries to get a competent rep (like always with AT&amp;T...lol). They will either disable 2FA or figure out a different way to authenticate your account.<br><br>We do need to put a disclaimer that some people have reported that they tried contacting AT&amp;T about the 2FA issue and had not been able to get it resolved for weeks. Hopefully you won't have to deal with this issue.&nbsp;<br><br>Another option is to reset your password online by answering the security questions. Unfortunately, you would have to do this each time you want to log in.<br><br><em>*Note: 2FA does not happen every time you log in. Only on devices that you use for the first time (or in a while) to log in to your account and then verify with the 2FA code.</em></p>

For example, when observing a Fast.com speed test, it looks like AT&amp;T allows a video burst and then throttles to 3.4 Mbps after the burst, even with SS off. Based on the reports, we believe that this may be regional or sporadically applied. Even then, some people see Fast.com get the 3.4 Mbps throttle, but can still stream HD just fine with no issues. So, definitely check your streaming services to see if you actually experience a <a href="page5.html#tabs1-1t" class="text-secondary">video throttle</a>.<br><br>However, some have reported solving the issue by doing this (may or may not work for you):<br>1. Turn on SS<br>2. Wait 5 mins<br>3. Completely reboot device<br>4. Wait 5 mins<br>5. Test Speedtest.net &amp; Fast.com to confirm the video throttle is on<br>6. Turn off SS<br>7. Wait 5 mins<br>8. Completely reboot device<br>9. Wait 5 mins<br>10. Test Speedtest.net &amp; Fast.com to confirm the video throttle is off<br></p>

This plan description is inaccurate because it states that there is only SD video streaming. However, it is confirmed that the plan still includes the Stream Saver feature and it can be turned off to remove the video throttle for HD+ video streaming.<br>&gt; The plan might now have&nbsp;<em>possible</em> deprioritization from the beginning (instead of after 22 GB, as previously). But this rarely affects anything.</p>

People using the SIM in a cellular router weren't affected because AT&amp;T doesn't classify their usage as "hotspot data" due to their APN settings.&nbsp;<br>&gt; The hotspot data usage counter doesn't show up on the account until hotspot data is actually first used</p>
